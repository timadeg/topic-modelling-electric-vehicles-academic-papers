TITLE: ANALYZING AND UNCOVERING PATTERNS IN RENEWABLE ENERGY INTEGRATION AND ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING RESEARCH THROUGH TOPIC MODELING TECHNIQUES

Description
This is a Topic modelling project using BERTopic and LDA Gensim

There are four files

1. Timothy_Adegbola_Topic_Modelling.ipynb (to be run on jupyter or colab only)
2. Timothy_Adegbola_Topic_Modelling.py  (to be run on linux virtual env only)
3. requirements.txt (contains all python package dependencies)
